			<h2 style="text-align:center;">The History</h2>
			<p>Tracing back to the origins of weightlifting as a concept is impossible. Humans have been lifting heavy things since they first existed. 
			Glorifying great feats of strength and strength competition dates back to the ancient Greeks and Egyptians. 
			However, these competitions were performed with stones and bags of sand rather than a barbell and some steel plates. 
			<br>Weightlifting was first introduced to the Olympic games in 1896, then was sporadically in and out of the Olympics until 1920. 
			This is when the main governing body of Olympic weightlifting was founded: the International Weightlifting Federation (or IWF). 
			In these times rather than the snatch and clean and jerk which we know today, there were many variations of them included in competition, such as the 'one-handed snatch' and 'one-handed clean.' 
			These one-handed lifts were quickly nixed by 1928, leaving the snatch, clean and jerk, and clean and press. 
			The clean and press lasted almost 50 years before finally being taken out of competiton, due to judging descrepancies. 
			Throw in some weight classes to keep the sport compeitive and fair, and this characterizes the sport we have today!

			<h2 style="text-align:center;">The Benefits</h2>
			<p>Exercise has been categorized as a healthy habit for quite some time now. 
			As you dive deeper into learning about exercise you'll come to learn how broad of a topic it is. 
			Exercise ranges from running, to lifting weights, to playing a sport, to even cleaning your house. 
			All of these forms of exercise will work different muscle groups and energy systems in different ratios in our body. 
			Most people who aren't too familiar with exercise but try to stay healthy will have the body's long-term energy system covered (running, bike riding, rowing). 
			Most of these exercises will leave out other important aspects of fitness- mainly the ones that the olympic lifts cover- strength and comfort in joint end-ranges of motion, and the mobility to get to those end-ranges. 
			This is where olympic weightlifting (or even regressions of the olympic lifts) can be very beneficial when properly taught. 
			Lack of control over the range of motion of a joint can lead to injury, acute or chronic. 
			As skill in the olympic lifts progress, a lifter can even do multiple repititions of them or reduce rest times between sets to build up the 'long-term' energy systems. 
			This won't be nearly as effective as going for a run, but it's important to try to cover all aspects of health in some way.
