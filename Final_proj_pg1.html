			<h2 style="text-align:center;">An Overview</h2>
			<p>Olympic Weightlifting is a sport consisting of three exercises: the snatch, and the clean and jerk. 
			In competition, the weight lifted between each exercise is added together and the lifter with the highest total wins.</p>
			<p>There are many people to perform the olympic lifts as lesuirely exercise rather than for competition, and this can provide great benefits for the body.
			Further discussed in <a href='Final_proj_pg3.html' tabindex='5'>The Lifts</a> section of this site, when performed under proper instruction the olympic lifts are a great way to strengthen joints at their end-ranges of motion.
			This is often overlooked in traditional strength training (some may argue that olympic lifting IS traditional strength training), and can lead to injury.
